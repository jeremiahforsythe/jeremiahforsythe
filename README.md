My name is Jeremiah Forsythe, and I am a Cybersecurity Researcher, technology enthusiast, and lifelong learner of programming and AI. The world often seems dull to me, but the ever-evolving realms of Cybersecurity and programming ignite my drive and passion. In my free time, I delve into the Forex and crypto markets, another area of keen interest for me.

Currently, I am aspiring to transition into Software Engineering, while also remaining open to opportunities in DevSecOps. I hope my GitHub reflects my dedication and passion for these fields.
